# Road Map

- Set up Shibboloth as IDP
- Demonstrate MFA in SAML integrations
- Demonstrate Federation concept in Gluu
- Demonstrate step up authentication
- Demonstrate MFA by either side of Federated IDP (Is it a good use case?)
- Setup Opensource based LDAP (OpenDJ / Apache Directory)
- Did we forget about OIDC?
- SimpleSAML with encryption and signing enabled


### ssp-sp-gluu-idp-custom-attr 
- Basline project is ssp-sp-gluu-idp
- Define [custom attributes in Gluu](https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/4.0/admin-guide/attribute/#custom-attributes) 
- For now, the custom attributes are alias of existing attribute in backend database (opendj)
