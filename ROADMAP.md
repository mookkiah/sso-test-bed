# Road Map

- Set up Shibboloth as IDP
- Demonstrate MFA in SAML integrations
- Demonstrate Federation concept in Gluu
- Demonstrate step up authentication
- Demonstrate MFA by either side of Federated IDP (Is it a good use case?)
- Setup Opensource based LDAP (OpenDJ / Apache Directory)
- Did we forget about OIDC?
- SimpleSAML with encryption and signing enabled
